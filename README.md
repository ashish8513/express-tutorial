# Express Server Project

This project is a basic Express.js server, which serves as a backend for handling HTTP requests. The server can be used as a starting point for building APIs or serving web content.

## Features

- Basic Express.js server setup
- Middleware integration
- Supports API endpoints
- Easy to extend for handling routes and database connections

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
├── package.json            # Project metadata and dependencies
├── server.js               # Main Express server file
├── routes/                 # Define API routes here
├── controllers/            # Define logic for each route
├── middlewares/            # Define custom middleware functions
├── public/                 # Static files (if serving frontend)
├── README.md               # Project documentation (this file)
```````
2. Navigate into the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd your-project-directory
3. Install dependencies
Once you are inside the project directory, install all necessary dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
4. Start the server
After installing the dependencies, start the Express server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Alternatively, if you are using nodemon (for automatic restarts on file changes), you can run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
By default, the server will start on port 3000. You can open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to check if the server is running.
